	abstract = {Queues at emergency rooms (ER) are prioritized based on the patient's sickness level. As a consequence, patients with low priority frequently have to wait excessively long. At Mercy Hospital, we began to study means by which such time would be reduced, without putting in jeopardy the life of critical patients. As an initial effort, we studied the flow of patients at the Emergency Department (ED) and decided to model it with and without a fast track lane. A simulation study revealed that indeed a fast track lane reduces by almost 25\% the time in the system for patients with low priority without negatively affecting the times of patients with higher priority.},

	abstract = {Hospital emergency departments are complex systems, characterized by uncertainty and variability, often operating with limited resources and high demands. Simulations of these departments have proven to be efficient tools in improving their performance in certain circumstances, however the human aspect is often overlooked in the application of modeling and simulation to this field. This paper describes an ongoing project which is applying agent-based modeling techniques to the simulation of hospital emergency departments. The work performed so far, including system analysis and a preliminary model, are shown and the advantages of this technique explored.},

	doi = {10.1109/WSC.2014.7019998},
	abstract = {Emergency Rooms (ER) are resource constrained systems that demand efficient management in order to fulfill their care and service objectives. This article explores the use of real-time simulation to improve daily operations at an ER where unplanned events may occur. Such a simulation model must adequately portray the current state of the system; however ER workflow management systems often provide only limited information for this purpose. This paper studies the impact of the model's ability to predict ER performance with a limited amount of input information, such that what-if questions may be asked to guide decision making. Towards this end, two input data scenarios are compared to a case of perfect information. One scenario considers only patient arrival times and the other assumes additional knowledge of patient care pathways. Although both generate similar performance measures, the case with least information yields a slightly worse estimate of patient care pathway composition.},

@inproceedings{wang_agent-based_2009,
	title = {An agent-based simulation for workflow in {Emergency} {Department}},
	doi = {10.1109/SIEDS.2009.5166148},
	abstract = {Patients always come to an emergency department (ED) to seek immediate medical care. Conversely, usually they experience prolonged waiting for nurses, physicians or radiology/lab procedures. There is a lot of public and private pressure on ED to improve the quality and efficiency of health care. As a result, ED workflow is under continuous changes. However, ED administrators usually lack a convenient decision support tool to evaluate the impacts of a changed workflow. They often find unexpected ED performance degeneracy after some workflow changes. This paper introduces an agent-based simulation which models various phases in the ED workflow, such as triage, nurse screen, resident exam, attending exam, lab/radiology, and disposition. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (1) to develop an agent-based simulation to allow free exploration of the ED performance under various settings; (2) to characterize and study the ED performance under different settings of the triage process and radiology procedure process. The analysis of two simulated cases is presented to illustrate how the changes of the triage process and the radiology process impact the patient throughput time and the other critical performance measures. The simulation outcome and empirical data demonstrate a similar change pattern after a modification in the triage process. The findings in this study indicate that the agent-based simulation can be used by ED administrators to plan changes, locate bottlenecks, and study the non-linear relationships among different phases in the ED workflow.},

SIMAN is a powerful general purpose language which incorporates a number of special purpose features which are specifically designed to enhance the modeling of manufacturing systems. These features greatly simplify the task of modeling the material handling component of a manufacturing system. The modeling concepts included in SIMAN are illustrated by several small example models. In addition, a recent application of SIMAN to model a manufacturing system at an industrial plant is discussed. This application involved a comparison of proposed group technology layouts against the existing conventional layout in the plant.},
